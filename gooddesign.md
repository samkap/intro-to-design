# Principles of Good Design

## Principles of Good Design
* **“Good Design is invisible”**<br>
— Dieter Rams, [10 Principles of Good Design](https://readymag.com/shuffle/dieter-rams/)
<br><br>
It doesn't stand out, it looks seamless and effortless.
* **“Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.”** <br>
— Jeffrey Zeldman, [Content precedes design](http://www.zeldman.com/2008/05/06/content-precedes-design/)

* **“Art is about aesthetics, Design is about function’s effect on aesthetics.”**<br>
— Sam, me, right now.
