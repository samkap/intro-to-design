# Typography

Ask most web designers and they'll agree with the old web design quote "95% of web design is typography". It _is_ that important in web design

* **Include line-height on all typographic elements**<br> `line-height` can completely change your site. Headlines should have a `line-height` of at least `1.2` or `1.3` and body copy (paragraphs and long reads) should have a `line-height` of at least `1.6` or `1.7`. <br>
`line-height: 1.6` can be applied to `body` css and then changed only when needed on individual type styles. <br>

* **Let the website design carry the tone, and pick typefaces that are readable, not overdone**<br>
Type expert John Kane recommends picking typefaces based on the
  * history of a font
  * the intended audience
  * the intended tone
  * the context in which the text is presented

* **Use a max-width on text elements like `<p>` and `h-elements`** <br> Shoot for 50-75 characters per line, including punctuation and spaces.

* **Always style the following for text in CSS**:
    * `font-family`
    * `font-size`
    * `line-height`
    * `font-weight`
    * `color`

* **Unless it's a headline, _stop_ centering type** <br>
Centering type is for short lines, headlines, or French restaurant menus. If you're writing a paragraph, left alignment is best because each line starts at the same place, which let's reader read quickly.
