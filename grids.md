# Grids


* **Depending on the language of your design, consider the direction that the language is typically read.**<br> For English, we read left to right, so this is why most websites keep their main content on the left and their ads on the right. Consider languages when designing a page and how elements are placed.

* **Use a grid system**
<br> Columns and math may seem tidious but it can really tie your site and it's content and elements together. Things will be systematic and not arbitrary choices. Also a grid isn't restricting, it actually opens up a lot of options.
<br> If grids seem overwhelming, start with a 12-column grid. It’s flexible because it’s divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, etc. 18- or 24- columns are pretty standard.

* **Grid lines are guides, but not rules**. Break the grid when you want something to stand out.

* **Patterns create consistency** <br>
Allow yourself to use patterns over and over as it builds consistency. (eg. 4-4-4, 6-6, 4-8, etc). Use something like [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) to make grids easier to work with or build out your own
